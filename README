HOW TO HELP:
Contributions welcome. Especially any additional blog
API support, or other systems with APIS (google docs,
facebook, anything on AMAZON). Translation of the
documentation into additional languages also 
appreciated.

For bugs and updates see:
https://github.com/jesse-b-semple/the_revolution_will_be_live
Or post your bugs and patches to pastebin with the "cablegate"
tag and I will be sure to seach for that tag regularly:
http://pastebin.ca

If you are using a slow proxy and get this error try again a 
few times:
xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 4
